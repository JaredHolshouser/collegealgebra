            A certain polynomial function <m>f(x)</m> has roots {{#roots}}<m>x={{r}}</m>, {{/roots}}.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph <m>y=f(x)</m> is shown below (graph may not be to scale).

    <content><p>Based on the graph's end behavior, is the leading coefficient of <m>f(x)</m> <em>positive or negative</em>? Explain how the graph tells you which.

    <outtro><p>The leading coefficient is <em>{{lctext}}</em> for this polynomial.</p>
        <p>This is because, as <m>x</m> increases (as we read toward the right end of its graph), the value of <m>y</m> {{lcexplain}}.</p>

    <content><p>Based on the graph's end behavior, is the degree of <m>f(x)</m> <em>even or odd</em>? Explain how the graph tells you which.

        </content>
    <outtro><p>The degree of this polynomial must be <em>{{parity}}</em>.</p>
        <p>We can tell because as <m>x\to-\infty</m> we have <m>f(x) \to {{lend}}</m>, and as <m>x\to\infty</m> we have <m>f(x) \to {{rend}}</m>.</p>
        <p>Since these two end behaviors {{match}} (the <m>y</m>-values approach {{matchtwo}} infinities), this means the degree of <m>f(x)</m> is {{parity}}.</p>
