        Searching for a relationship between {{#iv}}{{desc}} (<m>{{var}}</m>, measured in {{units}}){{/iv}} and {{#dv}}{{desc}} (<m>{{var}}</m>, measured in {{units}}){{/dv}}, you collect the following three data points:</p>
            <p><m>\quad \begin{array}{l|rrr} {{#iv}}{{var}} \quad \text{({{units}})}{{/iv}} &amp; {{Px}} &amp; {{Qx}} &amp; {{Rx}} \\ \hline
            {{#dv}}{{var}} \quad \text{({{units}})}{{/dv}} &amp; {{Py}} &amp; {{Qy}} &amp; {{Ry}}\end{array}</m>

        <p>Can you tell, from these three data points alone, whether it is possible that there is a <em>function</em> <m>f</m> such that <m>{{#dv}}{{var}}{{/dv}} = f\bigl({{#iv}}{{var}}{{/iv}}\bigr)</m>?</p><p>What about whether <m>{{#iv}}{{var}}{{/iv}} = f\bigl({{#dv}}{{var}}{{/dv}}\bigr)</m>?</p><p> Explain your answers.

    <content><p>Still curious, you plot these three data points on a piece of graph paper. Wandering by, your roommate {{stu}} catches a glance of your graph.

            <p>"Oh!" {{pn}} say{{suf}}. "I see the pattern in these three points!" Before you can say anything, {{pn}} draw{{suf}} a blue scribbled curve through your three points on the graph.</p>

         <p>(Remember, your answers should address the mathematical definition of "function" only. You should not need to speculate on whether there is a causal independent-dependent variable relationship between these two quantities... there probably is not!)</p>
