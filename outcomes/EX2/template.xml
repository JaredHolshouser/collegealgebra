    <content><p>Explain in 1-2 sentences how you can tell which of the graphs above is the graph of the function <m>f(x) = {{f}}</m>. Describe how the features of the correct graph match the features of this function's formula.</p>

    <outtro><p>The function <m>f(x) = {{f}}</m> matches graph {{ans}}.</p>

    <content><p>By changing just one of the numbers <m>{{A}}, {{b}}, </m> or <m>{{k}}</m>, show how to turn your graph from Task 1 into one of the other graphs shown above. Explain in 1-2 sentences how and whether your choice represents a kind of exponential growth, or exponential decay, and why.</p>

    <outtro><p>The three functions graphed are</p>
        <p><m>\quad f(x) = {{f1}}</m></p>
        <p><m>\quad f(x) = {{f2}}\quad </m> and</p>
        <p><m>\quad f(x) = {{f3}}</m>.</p>
        <p>See if you can match which is which!</p>
