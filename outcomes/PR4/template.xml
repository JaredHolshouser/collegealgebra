           Shown below is the graph of a rational function <m>y=f(x)</m> which has:

                Determine, in factored form, a formula for a rational function whose graph has the features shown. </p>
            <p> Explain, in one sentence each, the reason for the factors that appear in your formula.

            A factored form for the original graph might be: <me>\displaystyle f(x) = {{A}}\frac{ {{num}} }{ {{den}} } .</me>

                Squinting, you discover that you missed a feature of the graph: a "hole" in the graph at the point <m>({{hx}},{{hy}})</m>.

                Modify your answer to Task #1 to determine a formula for this new "punctured" graph, in factored form.

            When the "hole" at <m>({{hx}},{{hy}})</m> is included, <me>\displaystyle f(x) = {{A}}\frac{ {{numh}} }{ {{denh}} } .</me>

    <content><p>Multiply and simplify your answers to Tasks #1 and #2. Explain briefly why the factored form of a rational expression gives more helpful information about it than this standard form does.</p>

        The function in Task 1 simplifies to <me>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{ {{nums}} }{ {{dens}} }.</me>

        The function in Task 2 simplifies to <me>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{ {{numhs}} }{ {{denhs}} }.</me>
