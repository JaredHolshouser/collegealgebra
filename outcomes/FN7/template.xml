            In this first image is a graph of the "parent function" <m>y = {{expr}}</m> and two of its points, <m>P(0,0)</m> and <m>Q(1,1)</m>.

            In this second image is the graph of a transformation <m>y = f(x)</m> of this parent function, and the corresponding points <m>P'({{Px}},{{Py}})</m> and <m>Q'({{Qx}},{{Qy}}).</m>

            <em>Find a sequence of 3-5 individual transformation "steps"</em> (horizontal or vertical reflections, stretches/shrinks, shifts) which, performed in order, transform the parent function's graph into the transformed function's graph.</p><p>Describe each individual transformation (for example, "shift right by 4" or "stretch vertically by a factor of 3").

    <outtro><p>One possible sequence of transformation steps for this graph is:</p>

        <em>Find a formula for the transformed function's graph</em> by showing how the formula for the parent function <m>y = {{parent}}</m> is changed, one step at a time, through each one of the transformations you found in part (a).

        <p>This graph has the equation</p>

        <p>(If your answer looks different, try simplifying it further.)</p>
