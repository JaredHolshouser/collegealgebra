         The solution of the absolute-value inequality</p>
         <p><m>\quad \displaystyle{{a}} \bigl| {{var}} {{sgn}} {{b}} \bigr| \, {{ineq}} \, {{c}}</m></p>
          <p>can be expressed in interval notation as <m>{{origsol}}</m>.

        <p>
            By changing <em>exactly one</em> of either the <m>{{a}}</m>, <m>{{b}}</m>, <m>{{c}}</m>, or the inequality sign <m>{{ineq}}</m> in this problem, find a new inequality whose solution set is <m>{{newsol}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p> Provide a step-by-step solution of your new inequality, and accompany your answer with a sketch of the solution set as a shaded portion of the real number line.

        <p>There are many possible solutions to this problem!</p>
        <p>
            One solution would be the inequality</p>
        <p><m>\quad\displaystyle{{an}} \bigl| {{var}} {{sgnn}} {{bn}} \bigr| \, {{ineqn}}\, {{cn}}.</m></p>
        <p>Its number line is shown below. You may wish to check to see if there are other solutions!</p>
