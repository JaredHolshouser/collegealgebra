            While tutoring for a local high-school enrichment program, you're working with a student, {{stu}}, on the following problem:
        </p>
        <p><m>\text{Simplify the expression:}\quad {{st}} = </m></p>
        <p>
            {{stu}} has gotten the answer <m>{{incor}}</m>, which is incorrect. But {{pn}} didn't show their work.

            <outtro><p>
            The correct solution in this problem is <m>{{cor}}</m>.

                    <p>{{stu}} made a single algebra error on this problem that led to the incorrect answer <m>{{incor}}</m>. Looking at your own solution, find one step where a common algebra error would have resulted in the answer {{stu}} found.

            <p>
            The incorrect answer <m>{{incor}}</m> probably resulted from {{stu}} {{erred}}, computing instead the expression <me>{{wrongstep}} = {{incor}}.</me>

            <p>Write out that step-by-step <em>incorrect</em> solution that leads to the answer <m>{{incor}}</m>, highlighting the error. Explain to {{stu}} how to avoid such errors in the future.</p>
