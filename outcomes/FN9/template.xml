            "I think I'm finally getting inverse functions," {{stu}} tells you in the tutoring lab. "But I found this exercise in the textbook that got a little messy. It's an even-numbered problem so the answer isn't in the back of the book. Is it right?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem reads: <em>Determine the inverse function, if it exists, for: <m>\displaystyle f(x) = {{f}}.</m></em>
        </p>
        <p> "I got this answer," {{stu}} says, pointing on {{pos}} paper where {{pn}} wrote: </p>
        
        <p><m>\quad\displaystyle \text{The inverse is } g(x) = {{fi}}.</m></p>
        
        <p>"But that doesn't look right... it looks too much like the original function. That can't be right, can it?" {{pn}} ask{{suf}}.

        <p>Demonstrate how {{stu}} can <em>check</em> {{pos}} answer to determine whether this <m>g</m> is the inverse function to <m>f</m>, <em>without</em> simply solving the problem from the beginning.</p><p>Explain in writing the steps you're taking and how they tell you whether {{stu}}'s answer is correct or not. (There may be some tricky fraction algebra here... stick with it, be patient, and simplify as much as you can!)

            {{stu}}'s original answer is {{cor}}.
        </p>
        <p> To see why, remember that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverse functions we must have <m>f\bigl(g(x)\bigr) = x</m> and <m>g\bigl(f(x)\bigr) = x</m>.</p>
        
            <p>We can check that {{stu}}'s answer satisfies <m>f\bigl(g(x)\bigr) = \displaystyle {{fog}}</m> and <m>g\bigl(f(x)\bigr) = \displaystyle {{gof}}.</m>
